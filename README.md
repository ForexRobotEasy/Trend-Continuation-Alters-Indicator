# Trend Continuation Alters Indicator

This is the code for the Trend Continuation Alters indicator, which is a custom indicator developed for Forex Robot Easy. It generates buy and sell arrows on the chart based on trend continuation signals.

## How It Works
1. The indicator is initialized by adding it to the chart using the `ChartIndicatorAdd` function.
2. On each calculation iteration, the indicator checks for trend continuation signals.
3. If a trend continuation signal is detected, a buy or sell arrow is generated on the chart using the `ChartArrowAdd` function.
4. An alert is sent to the user indicating the currency pair, time frame, and alert reason using the `SendAlert` function.
5. The indicator continues to loop through the bars, checking for trend continuation signals and generating arrows and alerts as necessary.
6. The indicator is deinitialized by removing it from the chart using the `ChartIndicatorDelete` function.
